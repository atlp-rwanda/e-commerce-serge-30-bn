Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atlp-rwanda/e-commerce-serge-30-bn.git
```
2. Change into the repository directory:
```bash
cd e-commerce-serge-30-bn
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Set up the environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference. At a minimum, you'll need to set the `PORT` variable.
5. Start the server:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo
```

Accessing the Application
-------------------------

Once the server is running, you can access the application by navigating to the specified URL in your web browser. By default, the application might be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`, but this can vary depending on your configuration.

Database Configuration
----------------------

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to .env.
Update the `.env` file with your postgresSQL configuration settings.

Database Migration
------------------

1.Create migration file:
```
npx sequelize-cli migration:create --name <file-name>
```
2.Run Sequelize migration:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
3.Undo migration:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```

5.you can edit schema by editing migration file or by using seeders

* Create Seed file:
```
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name <name>
```
* Running seeds
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```
* Undoing seeds
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo
```

Database Migration
------------------
Docker
------

1.Create migration file:
```

```
2.Run Sequelize migration:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
3.Undo migration:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```
This application can be built and run using Docker:
Dockerfile

5.you can edit schema by editing migration file or by using seeders

* Create Seed file:
```
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name <name>
```
